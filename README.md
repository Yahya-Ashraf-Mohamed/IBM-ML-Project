# IBM-ML-Project

In this project, I have made a notebook where built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, then I cleaned the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. I used the following algorithms to build my models:

  - k-Nearest Neighbour

  - Decision Tree

  - Support Vector Machine

  - Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics:

  - Jaccard index

  - F1-score

  - LogLoass
